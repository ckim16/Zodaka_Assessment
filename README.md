# Instruction
You need your own CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, TOKEN, TOKEN_SECRET from Twitter. If you don't have one, please let me know and I will share mine (I have secured mine by putting in a file that is gitignored).<br/>
Clone this repo.<br/>
Go to the root folder and type 'npm install'.<br/>
Go the client folder and type 'npm run dev'.<br/>
Go to server/server.js and replace 'config.CREDENTIAL' properties with yours.<br/>
Open up another terminal window, go to the server folder and run 'npm start' (If you have already nodemon installed in your computer).<br/>
For server, if you do not have 'nodemon' installed, run the server by 'node server.js' in the Terminal.<br/>
After having webpack and server running, route to 'http://localhost:8080/' in the browser.<br/>
