Clone this repo.<br/>
Go to the root folder and run 'npm install'.<br/>

Go to server/server.js and replace 'config[CREDENTIAL]' with yours.<br/>
Open up another terminal window, go to the server folder and run 'npm start' (If you have nodemon installed in your computer).<br/>
For server, if you do not have 'nodemon' installed, just run node server.js in the Terminal.<br/>
