You need your own CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, TOKEN, TOKEN_SECRET from Twitter. If you don't have one, I will provide mine (I have secured mine by putting in a file that is gitignored).
Clone this repo
Go to the root folder and run 'npm install'
Go the client folder and run 'npm run dev'
Go to server/server.js and replace 'config[CREDENTIAL]' with yours.
Open up another terminal window, go to the server folder and run 'npm start' (If you have nodemon installed in your computer)
For server, if you do not have 'nodemon' installed, just run node server.js in the Terminal
After having webpack and server running, route to 'http://localhost:8080/' in the browser
